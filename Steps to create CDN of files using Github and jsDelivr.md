## Steps to create CDN of files using Github and cdn.jsdelivr.net

Step1: Need to upload files on a github repo.<br><br>
Step2: Need to copy the pathname of file stored on github repo.<br>
Eg: /yashraj24october/repo_name/file_path<br>

Step3: we can create our cdn of the file by using this url pattern:

<b>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<copied_file_pathname_from_github></b><br><br>

Now, your CDN is ready to use! <br>

We can now attach the cdn url in your project and use your resource with fast speed
